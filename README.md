# 🚀 My Portfolio 2025

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and the cool stuff I've been building. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS because why not make it modern and fast?

## ✨ What's Cool About It

- **Smooth AF**: Clean design with buttery smooth animations
- **Works Everywhere**: Looks great on your phone, tablet, or that massive monitor
- **Interactive Vibes**: Custom cursor, sparkles, and hover effects that make it feel alive
- **Project Showcase**: My babies (projects) with pretty pictures and descriptions
- **Skills Section**: All the tech I've been playing with, organized and pretty
- **Fast**: Built with Next.js so it loads like lightning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - Because the app router is the future
- **TypeScript** - For that sweet type safety
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.4** - Utility-first styling that just works
- **Custom Animations** - Because static is boring
- **SVG Icons** - Crispy and scalable

## 🚀 Want to Run It Locally?

```bash
# Clone it down
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd my-app

# Install the good stuff
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then head to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and check it out!

## 🎨 Making It Yours

### Styling

- Tweak `tailwind.config.ts` for your color scheme
- Mess with `src/app/globals.css` for global styles
- Customize components in `src/components/`

### Content

- Update your info in the components
